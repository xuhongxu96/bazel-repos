WARNING: /data/h445xu/repo/bazel-repos/cloned_repos/bazel-contrib__bazel-lib/MODULE.bazel:64:24: The module extension go_deps defined in @gazelle//:extensions.bzl reported incorrect imports of repositories via use_repo():

Not imported, but reported as direct dependencies by the extension (may cause the build to fail):
