DEBUG: /data/h445xu/.cache/bazel/_bazel_hongxu/4030f423640e91477acf82db7802efef/external/gazelle+/internal/bzlmod/go_deps.bzl:653:36: The following Go modules were required by the root module at the given versions, but were implicitly updated to higher versions due to transitive dependencies:
 
  golang.org/x/tools: v0.21.1-0.20240508182429-e35e4ccd0d2d -> v0.30.0 

Update the root module's dependencies to match the resolved versions via:

  bazel run @io_bazel_rules_go//go -- get golang.org/x/tools@v0.30.0
