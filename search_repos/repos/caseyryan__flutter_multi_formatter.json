  "description": "A set of formatters for text and input fields. Not only it can format a phone number but also automatically detect a country dial code and the name of the country. It also can apply formatting for currencies e.g. you need to convert 100000 into a USD currency value representation. Add MoneyInputFormatter and you can get it e.g. like: $100,000.00 right on the fly or whatever you need. Just see the example of usage",
