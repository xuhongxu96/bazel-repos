  "description": "The purpose of a quota service is to prevent cascading failures in micro-service environments. The service acts as a traffic cop, slowing down traffic where necessary to prevent overloading services. For this to work, remote procedure calls (RPCs) between services consult the quota service before making a call. The service isn’t strictly for RPCs between services, and can even be used to apply quotas to database calls, for example.",
