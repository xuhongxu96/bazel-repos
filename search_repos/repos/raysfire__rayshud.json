  "description": "A simplistic yet bold HUD for TF2 made to cut out a lot of clutter included that of the stock hud. It includes both a 6s and 16v16 scoreboard that can be toggled by changing to and from the minimal mode. This HUD was made for myself, but I've been getting requests for it a lot lately, so I figured I'd upload what I've done so far for the general public to use.",
