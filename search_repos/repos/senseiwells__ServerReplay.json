  "description": "A completely server-side Minecraft fabric mod that allows you to record replays for replay mod or flashback. This mod allows you to record multiple players that are online on a server at a time, as well as any given chunk area. This will produce replay files which can then be used with the respective mod for viewing/rendering.",
